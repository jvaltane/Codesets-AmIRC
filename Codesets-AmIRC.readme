Author:       jvaltane@kapsi.fi (Joni Valtanen)
Uploader:     jvaltane@kapsi.fi (Joni Valtanen)
Type:         comm/irc
Requires:     AmIRC 3+, Codesets library 6+
Architecture: m68k-amigaos
Version:      1.0

Codesets AmIRC plugin makes possible to use AmIRC with UTF-8 capable
IRC-clients. Conversions are done by Codesets library. All incoming
"lines" are converted from UTF8 to amiga codeset. Some outgoing lines
are converted to UTF8. Servers or other clients seems to do message
conversion. See Limits why some things are working as they are.

Plugin is tested messages which contains nordic and German characters.

Work is based on Robin Cloutmans Typo plugin (Typo.AmIPlug) and reuses its
code.

Source code is included in release package. There is also source repository
at GitHub: https://github.com/jvaltane/Codesets-AmIRC

Features

* able to switch on or off and ask status using /UTF8 command
* converts all incoming rawlines from server (Rawline hook)
* converts all incoming DCC chat lines from UTF8 to Amiga (DCCChat hook)
* converts some special commands to UTF8. (/TOPIC, /AWAY, /QUIT...)
* should work with multiple instances of AmIRC, but not tested

Requirements

* AmIRC 3.0 or higher (3.9 tested)
* Codesets library. (6.22 tested)

List of commands converted to UTF8

/WHO, /AWAY, /OPER, /PART, /PASS, /QUIT, /USER, /TOPIC, /SETNAME, /WALLOPS

Only some commands are tested, not all.

Use only "commandline" to these commands if it contains non-ascii characters.
See Limits section why.

Limits

* Not all UTF8 characters are converted. Only what Amiga character set and
  codesets supports.
* special command must be given from "commandline". For example if topic is
  set textflied at top AmRC handles it internally and that does not work.
* does not convert outgoing messages, but looks like servers or other
  clients does the job. Another thing is that AmIRC handles message lines.
  internally and provides messages without command part to hooks.
* can not join channels which includes non-ascii characters. AmIRC handles
  channel names internally and that causes problems when converting channels
  to UTF8.

For example, if you want to use non-ascii characters at topic you should set
it from "commandline" not topic input field at AmIRC. AmIRC does things
internally and does not give plugins capability to control everything.

Bugs

If you find any bugs or want to add some commands to list of UTF8 converted
commands, please report a bug or a feature to author. Even better is to report
issue at GitHub.
